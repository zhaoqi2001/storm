Install version 2.2 and create a new database by using "install.php". 
Use "phpliteadmin.php" to import your "old" database.

======================
Replace "index.php"


Usage
=====

0. Change language configuration in "setup.php"
1. Browse to ""http://YourDomain.com/squadxml/index.php"
2. Add at least one squad
3. Add members
4. Optional: Add pictures for squad logos to "http://YourDomain.com/squadxml/"
   in "PAA"-format.

	
IMPORTANT:

	* Dont forget to regular backup your database "squadxml.sqlite" to a local 
	  drive or usb stick
	 
	 
Security
========

To prevent other people from accessing your "squad.xml" protect your files
with ".htacces" and ".htpasswd". Just rename the delivered "htaccess.txt" 
and "htpasswd.txt" files and change username and password in the ".htpasswd"

Default is user:"root" with password:"123456". Dont forget to edit these 
files while they are still "*.txt" files.

See "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.htaccess" as first reference.
